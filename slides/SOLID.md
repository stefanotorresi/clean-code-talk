## SOLID principles

- **S**ingle Responsibility
- **O**pen Closed
- **L**iskov Substitution
- **I**nterface Segregation
- **D**ependency Inversion

------

### Single Responsibility Principle

*A class should have only one reason to change.*

Also see **Separation of Concerns**

------

### Open Closed Principle

*Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.*

------

### Liskov Substitution Principle

 *Let  &Phi;(x) be a property provable about objects **x** of type **T**, then &Phi;(y) should be true for objects **y** of type **S** where **S** is a subtype of **T**.*

------

### Interface Segregation Principle

*Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.*

------

### Dependency Inversion Principle

- *High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.*
- *Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.*

Not to be confused with **Dependency Injection** and **Inversion of Control**
